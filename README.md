# EMAIL Spam Classification
Built a ML Email classification model, using SVM and Logistic Regression model to classify Email as Spam or Ham. The SVM model achieved a good balanced metrics on the dataset, while the Logistic Regression model was tuned to prioritize Precision metric.

# Description
In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. The data has been made public and presents a diverse set of email information ranging from internal, marketing emails to spam and fraud attempts.The Enron email dataset contains approximately 500,000 emails generated by employees of the Enron Corporation. I have implemented an SVM Classifier and a Logisitc Regression model to classify the emails, using a TfidfVectorizer to create numerical vectors from the text, ranking words based on their frequency in the dataset.

## Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/the-flying-cow/Email-Spam-classification.git
cd Email-Spam-classification
```

Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Run the project
In your terminal/command prompt, navigate to the root folder and execute the following 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Inside the src folder, run the following

```bash
gradio gradio_ui.py
```
